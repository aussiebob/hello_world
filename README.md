Learning the github
Yipee 
Originally got interested with yacc and lex , lexical tokens and a recursive descent parser as a copmuter science project.
Worked for IBM in at various labs ending in Austin doing system design then front end RTL on IBM servers chips.
Now at Qualcomm in validation and want to work withj linux at work and home and gitbug seems to be a pre-requisite.
